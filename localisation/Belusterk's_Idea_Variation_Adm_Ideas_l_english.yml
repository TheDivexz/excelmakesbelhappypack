########################################################

 confuci0: "Confucianism"
 confuci0_desc: "Our state religion is Confucianism."
 confuci1: "Zuo Tradition"
 confuci1_desc: "It comprises thirty densely written chapters covering a period from 722 to 468 BC, and focuses mainly on political, diplomatic, and military affairs from that era. The Zuo Zhuan is famous for its 'relentlessly realistic' style, and recounts many tense and dramatic episodes, such as battles and fights, royal assassinations and murder of concubines, deception and intrigue, excesses, citizens' oppression and insurgences, and appearances of ghosts and cosmic portents."
 confuci2: "The Gongyáng Zhuàn"
 confuci2_desc: "Gongyang Zhuan argues that Chunqiu is not merely a history, but a manifesto of Confucius' philosophy on his ideal regarding sociopolitical order. Unlike Zuo Zhuan, a later favorite among many scholars for its vivid narrative of historical events, Gongyang Zhuan was compiled in a dialogistic style resembling a class conversation between a Confucian scholar and his students."
 confuci3: "Guliang Zhuan"
 confuci3_desc: "Written in question and answer style, the work annotates the Spring and Autumn Annals covering the period between the first year of State of Lu ruler Duke Yin of Lu (722 BCE) and the fourteenth year of his later counterpart Duke Ai of Lu (481 BCE). Like the Gongyang Zhuan the Guliáng Zhuàn is written as a didactic explanation of the subtle political and social messages of the Spring and Autumn Annals rather than in the anecdotal style of the Zuo Zhuan. It is an important book for the study of the development of Confucianism from the Warring States Period through the Han Dynasty."
 confuci4: "Kongzi Jiayu"
 confuci4_desc: "In the postface to the Kongzi Jiayu, its author describes the collection as discussions Confucius had with his disciples and others, recorded by his disciples. Selected discussions were published as the Analects (Lunyu), while the rest was collected in the Jiayu. This characterization is consistent with the content of the Jiayu, which contains nearly all the Confucian lore found in such diverse ancient texts as the Zuozhuan, Guoyu, Mencius, Han Feizi, Book of Rites, Han Shi Waizhuan, Lüshi Chunqiu, Huainanzi, etc., except what is included in the Analects, the Classic of Filial Piety, and a few other works."
 confuci5: "I Ching"
 confuci5_desc: "The core of the I Ching is a Western Zhou divination text called the Changes of Zhou (Zhou yì). Various modern scholars suggest dates ranging between the 10th and 4th centuries BC for the assembly of the text in approximately its current form. Based on a comparison of the language of the Zhou yi with dated bronze inscriptions, Edward Shaughnessy dated its compilation in its current form to the early decades of the reign of King Xuan of Zhou, in the last quarter of the 9th century BC."
 confuci6: "Erya"
 confuci6_desc: "The Erya has been described as a dictionary, glossary, synonymicon, thesaurus, and encyclopedia. Karlgren (1931: 46) explains that the book 'is not a dictionary in abstracto, it is a collection of direct glosses to concrete passages in ancient texts.' The received text contains 2094 entries, covering about 4300 words, and a total of 13,113 characters. It is divided into nineteen sections, the first of which is subdivided into two parts."
 confuci7: "Mencius"
 confuci7_desc: "The Mencius comprises 7 chapters, each divided into two halves, with alternating short sayings and extensive dialogues on specific philosophical arguments. Its fundamental positions, such as Mencius' famous argument in chapter 6A that human nature is inherently good, are usually presented as conversations between Mencius and contemporaneous thinkers, while arguments on specific issues usually appear in records of his advice and counsel to various rulers."

 shinto5: "Susanoo-no-Mikoto"
 shinto5_desc: "Alternately romanized as Susano-o, Susa-no-o, and Susanowo. Reportedly called 'Futsushi'. He is the god of storms as well as in some cases the god of the sea. He is also somewhat of a trickster god, as Japanese mythology extensively documents the 'sibling rivalry' between him and Amaterasu. Susanoo also was responsible for the slaying of the monster Yamata no Orochi and the subsequent discovery of the sacred sword Kusanagi."
 shinto6: "Ame-no-Uzume"
