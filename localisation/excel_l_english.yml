 # localization for the decision that shares overlord's ideas to subjects
 AICustomNation_title: "Share Your Ideas with the New Subjects"
 AICustomNation_desc: "Whenever a subject nation is released, they get a number of Ideas equal to the number of Ideas their overlord has. This way the new nation isn't automatically disadvantaged on the World Stage. Subjects will pick their own Idea Groups. Currently vassals get this feature automatically, but for Client States and Colonial Nations this decision is needed."

 insult_innovative_1:0 "What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you peasant? I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in the §W[From.GetAdjective]§! Army, and I've been involved in numerous secret raids on Kebabini, and I have over 30000 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I'm the top spearman in the entire army. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the diplomats? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am building my spy network across §W[Root.GetName]§! and §W[Root.Capital.GetCapitalName]§! is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You're fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the army and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little \"clever\" comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You're fucking dead, kiddo."
